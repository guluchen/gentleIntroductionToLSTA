abstract = {Efficient implementations of atomic objects such as concurrent stacks and queues are especially susceptible to programming errors, and necessitate automatic verification. Unfortunately their correctness criteria – linearizability with respect to given ADT specifications – are hard to verify. Even on classes of implementations where the usual temporal safety properties like control-state reachability are decidable, linearizability is undecidable. In this work we demonstrate that verifying linearizability for certain fixed ADT specifications is reducible to control-state reachability, despite being harder for arbitrary ADTs. We effectuate this reduction for several of the most popular atomic objects. This reduction yields the first decidability results for verification without bounding the number of concurrent threads. Furthermore, it enables the application of existing safety-verification tools to linearizability verification.}

abstract = {Efficient methods for the simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers are crucial for their analysis due to the exponential growth of the problem size with the number of qubits. Here we study lumping methods based on bisimulation, an established class of techniques that has been proven successful for (classic) stochastic and deterministic systems such as Markov chains and ordinary differential equations. Forward constrained bisimulation yields a lower-dimensional model which exactly preserves quantum measurements projected on a linear subspace of interest. Backward constrained bisimulation gives a reduction that is valid on a subspace containing the circuit input, from which the circuit result can be fully recovered. We provide an algorithm to compute the constraint bisimulations yielding coarsest reductions in both cases, using a duality result relating the two notions. As applications, we provide theoretical bounds on the size of the reduced state space for well-known quantum algorithms for search, optimization, and factorization. Using a prototype implementation, we report significant reductions on a set of benchmarks. In particular, we show that constrained bisimulation can boost decision-diagram-based quantum circuit simulation by several orders of magnitude, allowing thus for substantial synergy effects.},
