\begin{abstract}
Quantum technology is progressing at a remarkable pace and holds the potential to transform numerous sectors both nationally and globally.
%
As quantum systems become more advanced and increasingly prevalent, ensuring their correctness is of paramount importance. This underscores the urgent need for rigorous tools capable of analyzing and verifying their behavior.
%
Nevertheless, the development of such verification tools presents substantial challenges. Distinct quantum phenomena—most notably superposition and entanglement—give rise to program behaviors that diverge fundamentally from those observed in classical computing. These characteristics lead to inherently probabilistic models and result in exponentially large state spaces, even for relatively simple systems.
%

In this tutorial we will illustrate initial steps that aims to tackle these challenges by leveraging the knowledge acquire in our community's on the verification of traditional systems.
%
The objective is to design and implement novel verification frameworks that adapt the proven strengths of classical verification—such as succinct property specification, precise fault detection, automation, and scalability—to the quantum domain.
